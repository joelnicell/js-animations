# JS Animations Playground

This project is a simple webpage designed as a playground to experiment with various animation techniques for the web. Since I needed content to test each of these approach out on, I decided to share my thoughts directly in this document. Each section's animations are powered by the technique that I am discussing in that section.

## What I cover

I try out a few different animation approaches, exploring the following:
- How intuitive each approach is for practical examples
- Limitations of each approach
- Test with real world case of 'animating on scroll'

## Examples

In this page I talk about:
- requestAnimationFrame() api
- animate() api
- css animation classes
- Framer motion library

    <h1>Animation techniques for the web</h1>
		<p>The tick boxes for effective websites with animations are:</p>
		<li>
			<ul>Highly semantic</ul>
			<ul>Fast</ul>
		</li>
		<p>We can rate each of these approaches to see how well they match up in these areas. As well as seeing the animating power of each approach.</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Example 1: Javascript updates css</h2>
			<p>In this example, a box div is having it's css style attribute updated by an animation loop from Javascript.</p>
			<div class="box example-one" id="box-eg-one"></div>
			<p>Here is the code snippet:</p>
			<pre>
				<code class="code-snippet">
						const box = document.getElementById("box");
		
						let value = 0;
						function animate(t) {
							value = Math.sin(t * 0.001) * 40 + 100;
							box.style.width = `${value}px`;
							requestAnimationFrame((t) => animate(t))
						}
		
						animate();
				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>What are the pros to this approach?</p>
	
			<li>
				<ul>Updates are controlled by the well understood and easy-to-understand animation cycle</ul>
				<ul>State is controlled inside of animation cycle.</ul>
				<ul>One line of code is directly impacting html css, so not only is the processing 'native', but also keeps semantic relationships in tact</ul>
				<ul>Easy to manage animation cycle, and is relatively easy to inject interactivity with event listeners etc. in vanilla JS</ul>
				<ul>Not re-writing HTML, only changing styles via css</ul>
			</li>
	
			<p>What are the cons to this approach?</p>
			<li>
				<ul>Value's constantly changing in the DOM tree. Opening the command palette sees updates occuring regularly</ul>
				<ul>limited by the styling of css. Stays within the 'box' model.</ul>
				<ul>The threading inside of a single animation loop is singular, even though the loop itself is asynchronous. This means animations could slow down</ul>
			</li>
	
			<h3>Keeping semantics in tact:</h3>
			<button class="example-one" id="button-eg-one">Try and click me!</button>
			<p>This example seems to have a pretty tight relationship between a user's interaction with the page, and the state of the animation.</p>
			
			<h3>Final review:</h3>
			<p>This approach seems <strong>ideal</strong> for interactive animated elements. Not only because it ticks semantic boxes in it's purest sense, but also because in general, interactive elements (buttons, scrolling events etc.) should not be over-complicated by animations anyway. The button above is already really annoying for users to try and click. Why would you want MORE animation on an interactive element?</p>
			<p>I think if this technique can be pushed to it's limits, then it could prove highly effective.</p>

    <h1>Animation techniques for the web</h1>
    <h2>Example 1: Javascript updates css</h2>
    <p>In this example, the box's css style attribute is being updated inside of an animation loop inside of Javascript.</p>
    <div class="box" id="box"></div>
    <p>Here is the code snippet:</p>
    <code class="code-snippet">
        const box = document.getElementById("box");

        let value = 0;
        function animate(t) {
            value = Math.sin(t * 0.001) * 40 + 100;
            box.style.width =  `${value}px`;
            requestAnimationFrame((t) => animate(t))
        }

        animate();
    </code>
		<p>What are the pros to this approach?</p>

		<li>
			<ul>Updates are controlled by the well understood and easy-to-understand animation cycle</ul>
			<ul>State is controlled inside of animation cycle.</ul>
			<ul>Easy to manage animation cycle, and is relatively easy to inject interactivity with event listeners etc. in vanilla JS</ul>
			<ul>One line of code is directly impacting css, so is native</ul>
		</li>

		<p>What are the cons to this approach?</p>
		<li>
			<ul>Value's constantly changing in the DOM tree. Opening the command palette sees updates occuring regularly</ul>
			<ul>The threading inside of a single animation loop is singular, even though the loop itself is asynchronous. This means animations could slow down</ul>
		</li>
